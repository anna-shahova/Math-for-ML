## Bias-variance

The code includes the generation and visualization of a polynomial function, visualization of different polynomials fits and their comparison by parameters bias-variance.

## Regression, overfitting and trees

The code includes the generation random noise, the creation of train and test split, visualization and fitting polynomial and regression tree models. The models are also analyzed for quality and ability to make predictions.
